this is a package added, to work with the HGam framework

It reads MxAOD, and produce trees and histograms : they include the predicted yields, with events of systematic common or uncommon to the nominal, in order to be able to derivate analytically the error of the systematic, so that we could know if the systematic is significative or a stat-only fluctuation
