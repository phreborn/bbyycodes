Based on code in the ``statistics'' package from HONGTAO YANG

Calculate the uncertainty due to systematics by the following method:

1. Obtain covariance matrix from fit to pre-fit Asimov
2. Generate toys with covariance matrix
3. For each toy, integrate the yield from 120 - 130 GeV
4. Compute the 1 sigma variation over all toys 

How to use:

1. You first need to generate some asimov data with cont. bkg parameters from sideband + SM signal
2. Modify src/calcNbkgHighMassgg with the appropriate POIs and uncertainties in the WS. Need to run this a few times, once per POI you want to calculate the uncertainty on.
3. Setup and compile with source setup.sh && make bin/calcNbkgHighMassgg
5. Run with the script run_yybb.sh
6. Sanity check: central value should not be changed
